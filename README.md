# 50_Startups-using-MLR

Here I am working on Multiple Linear Regression which is same like Simple Linear Regression, but the only difference is
In Simple Linear Regression we work only with one dependent and one independent variable,
but in Multiple Linear Regression we can work more than one dependent variable and independent variable. 

Apart from this we follow same steps as Simple Linear Regression.
